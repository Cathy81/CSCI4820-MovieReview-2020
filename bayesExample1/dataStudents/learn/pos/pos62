Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a movie that's very fun to watch. Every moment of the movie is enjoyable, with its realistic character dialogue and compelling motivation. This movie gave me an experience I haven't had watching a movie in a very long time, and I appreciated how down to earth it kept itself while still reaching serious themes.
