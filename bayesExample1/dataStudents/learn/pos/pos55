The film was not bad. The plot could have used further detail and development. It is quite clear that most of the writer's attention went toward the comedy. To be honest this is what made the movie enjoyable. Even though I probably wouldn't watch it a second time, I would recommend it to others. if they're looking for a good laugh.
