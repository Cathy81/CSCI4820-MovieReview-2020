For many people in the hacking community Wargames was the film that gave us the first insight into the magic of hacking. This film is so important that it gave the technique "wardialing" its name. Wargames has a perfect sript, stunning special effects and a great soundtrack. It will go down in history as a cinematic gem. Miss it at your peril.
