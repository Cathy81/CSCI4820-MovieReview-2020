Another Version of You is a very interesting and compelling movie that can be emotional and funny within minutes of itself. The movie has a very good premise it doesn't waste for a moment, and really drives home how permanent the decisions its main character makes are. The message of the movie is made clear by the realistic outcomes that are created, rather than it needing to tell you over and over again.
