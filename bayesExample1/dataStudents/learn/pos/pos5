The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities.
