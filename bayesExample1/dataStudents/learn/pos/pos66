Padak is an interesting experience if you prefer a slower movie that allows you to really consider the moral dillemnas it presents. The ending is somewhat unfulfilling and punishing, despite the themes leading towards more development for its characters, but the unfair twist is just another part of what makes this movie a good watch.
