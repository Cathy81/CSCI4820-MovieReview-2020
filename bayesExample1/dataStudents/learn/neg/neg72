How very much I love the first half of this film, with its gorgeous attention to period detail and heartfelt tenderness between the characters...
Then, I was hit with a wave of terrible childish jokes, complete plot controdictions, and an unsatisfiying ending. 
This is the definition of a smooth take off with a crash landing.
