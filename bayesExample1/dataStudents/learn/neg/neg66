The Happening is a movie based around the idea of an unseen force that begins to attack humanity entirely unprompted. The movie seemed interesting, until the unsatisfying ending revealing that the entity didn't need to be stopped, but simply could just stop on its own. This ruined the movie for me, and made the attempts at understanding the force throughout the movie even more unbearable.
