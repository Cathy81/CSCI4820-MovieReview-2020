I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually scared me. The acting wasn't too bad, and the killer was believable and disturbing. The plot of this movie is incredibly weak. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.A good scare, but a bad story.
