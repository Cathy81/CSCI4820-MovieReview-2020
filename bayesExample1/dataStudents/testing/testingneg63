The Silence is a movie with an interesting concept that unfortunately falls flat once the plot takes over. The horror elements are engaging, but the plot continually ignores them or manipulates them in unfair or completely unnecessary ways. The climax to the movie is especially weird, and just makes the entire viewing uncomfortable.
