God's Not Dead is a movie where caricatures of real life religious perspectives conflict within a college. The movie doesn't really address any of these perspectives realistically though, and instead goes for short punches that sound interesting but actually don't hold up. The characters change personality on a dime when it suits the plot, and are so clearly created explicitly to prove a point that the movie is unwatchable.
