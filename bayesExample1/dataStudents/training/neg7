Sadly "Piranha 3DD" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality. The director has no idea how to handle this and you can tell in the second half of this film. It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.
