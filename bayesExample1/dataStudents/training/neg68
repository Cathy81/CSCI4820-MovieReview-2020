Unfriended is a movie based around the idea of a monster who hunts people using a videochat, however, the execution of the movie is abysmal. The movie never directly addressed the logic of how its monster attacks, nor the reasoning behind its existance. The plot is paper thin, with it only being an excuse for the horror elements.
