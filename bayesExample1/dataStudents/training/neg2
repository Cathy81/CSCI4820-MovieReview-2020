There are plenty of PG and G movies that are equally enjoyable for children and adults. "Baby Geniuses 2" is not one of them. This film stinks higher than a 5 day old dirty diaper. If you thought the first one was the worst movie in recent history, you need to look no further to find the worst one of the past decade.
