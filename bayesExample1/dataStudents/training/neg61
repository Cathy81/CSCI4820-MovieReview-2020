I'm in Love with a Church Girl is a terrible movie with such unrealistic themes and characters that its almost painfully obvious what the moral message being pushed by the director is. The movie is only interesting to watch as sattire, and even then the amount of time it takes to get to a conclusion as you slowly watch the characters make more unrealistic decisions is painful.
