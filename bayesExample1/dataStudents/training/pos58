I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Most horror flicks have to change many details due to the concern of going over budget. However, this film overlooks no details mentioned in book thereby making the adaptation very good.
