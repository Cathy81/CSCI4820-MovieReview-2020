The Emoji Movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my hopefully short life. The funniest thing about this "jam packed comedy" was the fact that I was that nobody in the whole audience was laughing. The plot was predictable I felt no emotion towards a single character. The puns were poo quite literally.
