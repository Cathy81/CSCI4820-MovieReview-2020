I was recently forced to sit through Meet the Spartans. The humor in this movie was just as awful as i thought it would be and i could predict the entire movie. I'll close by saying that if you're forced to watch this movie, rip your eyes out of your skull and pour salt into your head. It will be much more enjoyable.
